# Monopoly
My attempt to fix my monopoly calculator

You see, I have this cool version of monopoly that uses debit cards. Each player gets a card that they stick into a little calculator thing that is used for transferring money from one person to another.

The batteries in my calculator exploded and corroded the whole thing, so I decided to create a mobilfe-friendly web app where people could use their phones to transfer money to other people as they play monopoly.

It also has some added advantages of eliminating the "how much money do I have?" question, which plagued games in the past. 

Also, many players can make transfers simultaneously so players are no longer waiting for the banker to do all their transactions.

There are 4 screens: Transfer, Balances, Game Log, and Settings

-Transfer allows for the transfer of money between accounts
-Balances displays current balances for all players, refreshed every couple seconds
-Game Log is simply a list of all transactions, refreshed every couple seconds
-Settings allows for game resets and changing player names.

There are opportunities for multiple UX and UI improvements, but I've played this version with 5 people on various devices (android, iPhone, iPad) and it worked great.
